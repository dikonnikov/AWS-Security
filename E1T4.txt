# Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

Web Service Instance in public network. A good nstance role allows access to all S3 buckets. This should be more restrictive and follow the least priviledge policy.

Web Serive Instance security group has enabled access to all ports from all IPs, this coiuld be used to exploit attacks.

S3 bucket is not encrypted and accessed through public internet. A good prectice is to have at least default encryption enabled on all s3 buckets. S3 buckets could be accessed via AWS VPC Endpoint to avoid data transfer via public Internet.
