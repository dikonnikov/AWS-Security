# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Moving the web server to private network. Adding Web Application Firewall would guard against common attack types.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Yes, if the policy attached to the VPC endpoint would restrict access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Enabling default encryption applies only to files uploaded after that fact.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
It would revert changes to the state described in the cloudformation files.
